#### Golang Madness
Michael learns to Go! A journey from extreme Java to mad Golang.
* Practices with Golang
    * Prime sieves
    * Counting inversions (similarity, left, right and split inversions)
* A take on `ByteBuffer/StringBuilder` and `slice/bytes.Buffer`
	* fix-sized `ByteBuffer` vs. dynamically sized `slice`
	* panic with error vs. multiple return values including error
	* method chaining vs. `append` and `copy` or util method with interface{}
	* object.oriented vs. functional
	* setter methods vs. `xxxTo`
	* honor the interfaces in common packages like `io`
* TCP communication in Go
	* infinite data server (financial ticks)
	* data client
