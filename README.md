#### Golang Madness
A journal from extreme Java to mad Golang
* A battle between `ByteBuffer/StringBuilder` and `slice/bytes.Buffer`
	* fixed size `ByteBuffer` vs. dynamic size `slice`
	* panic with error vs. multiple return value including error
	* method chaining vs. `append` and `copy`
	* object.oriented vs. functional
	* setter methods vs. `xxxTo`
* Ticks in Go
	* infinite tick server
	* tick client
